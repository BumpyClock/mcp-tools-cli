# TUI Functionality Fix Report

**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Status:** ✅ MOSTLY RESOLVED  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes

## 🚨 Issues Discovered & Fixed

### 1. **Phase 5 Component Import Failure**
**Problem**: SmartWizard import failing, causing Phase 5 features to be unavailable
**Root Cause**: Import was using `SmartWizard` but actual class is `SmartDeploymentWizard`
**Impact**: Only 2/6 Phase 5 features were available

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Changed in tui_app.py
from .smart_wizard import SmartDeploymentWizard  # Was: SmartWizard
self.smart_wizard = SmartDeploymentWizard(self.user_preferences)
```

### 2. **Health Monitoring Integration**
**Problem**: Async method being called sync in test causing confusion
**Root Cause**: Test was incorrectly calling `check_server_health()` directly instead of through worker
**Impact**: False impression that health monitoring was broken

**Resolution**: Health system works correctly in TUI context with async workers

## ✅ **Current Status**
