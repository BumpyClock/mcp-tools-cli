Deployment conflicts occur when there are incompatibilities or issues
with server configurations, platform requirements, or dependencies.

Types of Conflicts:
‚ö†Ô∏è  Version Mismatch - Server requires different version than available
üî¥ Missing Dependency - Required dependency not found on platform  
‚ö†Ô∏è  Configuration Error - Invalid or missing configuration parameters
üî¥ Platform Incompatible - Server not supported on target platform
‚ö†Ô∏è  Resource Conflict - Multiple servers trying to use same resources

Conflict Resolution:
‚Ä¢ Auto-resolve: Let the system fix common issues automatically
‚Ä¢ Manual resolve: Choose specific resolution for complex conflicts
‚Ä¢ Ignore: Mark conflict as acceptable and proceed anyway
‚Ä¢ Cancel: Stop deployment and fix issues manually

Cells with conflicts are highlighted in red in the deployment matrix.
